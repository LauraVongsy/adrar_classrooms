Fix the following mandatory requirements

   > instructions from http://getcomposer.org/. Then run "php
   > composer.phar install" to install them.

   Optional recommendations to improve your setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * intl extension should be available
   > Install and enable the intl extension (used for validators).

 * a PHP accelerator should be installed

 * realpath_cache_size should be at least 5M in php.ini
   > Setting "realpath_cache_size" to e.g. "5242880" or "5M" in

   > cases.
